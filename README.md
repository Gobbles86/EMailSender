# EMailSender
EMailSender application based on Derick Bailey's excellent article "S.O.L.I.D. Software Development, One Step at a Time" 
as published in Code Magazine (http://www.codemag.com/article/1001061). Note that the EMailSender and the Database part
were faked out since an actual implementation is not required in order to understand the SOLID principles, which is the 
aim of the article and this code.
For each stage in the article, there is a separate folder with a separate Visual Studio project. Apart from the first project, the folder names represent the principles which have already been considered.
Note that you need Visual Studio 2015 and Qt 5.6 or later in order to be able to compile and run this code.
